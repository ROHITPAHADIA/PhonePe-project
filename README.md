## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### ✅ 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/phonepe-insights.git
cd phonepe-insights
````

### 📦 2. Install Dependencies

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📁 3. Download Raw Data

Download the PhonePe Pulse dataset from the official repo:

👉 [https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse](https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse)

* Navigate to the `data` directory in this project.
* Copy the relevant folders such as `aggregated/` and `map/` into `/data`.

Your structure should look like:

```
/data
├── aggregated
│   ├── transaction
│   ├── user
│   └── insurance
└── map
    └── user
```

> **Important**: Keep the folder structure as above for the scripts to work correctly.

---

### 🧱 4. Generate the Database

Run the following commands one by one to create the schema and populate your SQLite database.

```bash
python scripts/create_all_tables.py
python scripts/load_aggregated_transactions.py
python scripts/load_aggregated_user.py
python scripts/load_aggregated_insurance.py
python scripts/load_map_user.py
```

> This will create `phonepe_data.db` under the `/db` folder.

---

### ▶️ 5. Launch the Streamlit Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
